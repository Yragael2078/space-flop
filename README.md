# Space flop

Space flop is my first pico-8 game.

It's a one button game taking place in space.

## Controls

In Space flop you use one single button, (X), to apply a burst to your ship in order to make it get higher.

## System

Your ship is flying at a constant speed and is subject to gravity.
In order to fly through gaps in posts you must rise it by applyiong boosts.

Your ship is equiped of shields on its top and bottom.
These shields protect you if you touch the borders of the gaps.

## Credits

This game was written by me, Sylvain Gaillard, when discovering Pico-8 and game developpement.
